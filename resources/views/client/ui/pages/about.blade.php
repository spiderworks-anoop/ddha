                    <h3>DEHRADUN HILLS ACADEMY <br/><span>BOUTIQUE DAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL</span></h3>
                    <p>In Jan, 1957 with a small amount from his personal savings Ch. Puran Singh who
came from a distinguished family of landed gentry and who had just started his
practice as a lawyer at the district courts Dehradun requested his wife Satyabala
to put their own residence at disposal to set up a small preparatory school for
boys and girls at Lytton road called ‘The Blue Bird’. This small initiative soon
became too big for the premises it occupied and had to be shifted to another
location close by.</p>
                    <p>Three decades later and with some experience of running schools the Puran Singh
family entrusted their younger son, Sandip Puran Singh – an environmentalist and
an old boy of Doon School to take charge and lay the foundation of Dehradun Hills
Academy at its present site on the outskirts of Doon valley close to the Rajaji
National Park with a belief that what the city-based children need most, was a
school set in quiet sylvan surroundings to encourage a mindful creative approach
to life.</p>
                    <p>Ch. Puran Singh’s philosophy of education was what we have now come to know
as a Progressive approach. In a boutique residential school it is vital that each
student is given every conceivable opportunity to find activities at which they
excel, in addition to what is on offer within the classroom, on the games field and
at the Amphitheatre.</p>
                  
                  
<p>The calm and positive atmosphere at the Dehradun Hills Academy results not only
from the verdant 7 acres campus with its fruit orchards and playing fields, but also
from the meaningful and structured research based learning giving each child his
or her own space to grow and blossom.</p>
                </div>



                <div class="col-md-12">

              
                    <p>The learning approach at the Academy is intended to ensure that students fulfill
all their potential, developing a diverse range of skills as laid down by the
Founding President of the Ch. Nain Singh Education Society.</p>
                   
                    <p>At DDHA we have seen that children who are encouraged to lead a happy life and
be themselves, go on to achieve not only academic excellence but find a purpose
and meaning in life. We evaluate our students’ overall growth not just by their
academic performance but by level of each child’s effort to get along with his/her
peer groups, the bonding within each other in the dormitory and the whole
school in general.</p>
                    <p>Our USP is a mindful approach where by igniting the self learning process in each
child, using creative methods like cooking, gardening, social networking,
storytelling and other similar activities we provide an environment in which
children from varied backgrounds and age groups come together, mingle and
amicably learn from each other.</p>
                    <p>Some of our alumni fraternity includes professionals from IIM Bangalore and
Kolkata, IIT Roorkee, University of Birmingham City (UK), NIFT, the Indian Armed
Forces and Banking Services to mention a few professions they have chosen after
completing their higher education.</p>
