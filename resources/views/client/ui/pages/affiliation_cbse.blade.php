                    <p> Our entire faculty is well trained and equipped to deliver the
curriculum and ensure that every student is challenged and  
encouraged to achieve their potential in all classes. We use Active
Learning strategies to make the teaching-learning experiences more
interesting and worthwhile. The teachers begin a class by clearly
stating the learning goal, ask children what they know already,
demonstrate an experiment or conduct a group activity, let children
speak before they do, ensure the “application questions” are done
independently, assess daily, and support each child individually.</p>
                    <p> The Junior, Middle and Senior School are an integral part of a
student’s learning, where we ensure progression in the development
of essential life skills. Students are encouraged to learn through a
sense of enquiry and develop a keen desire to know. The school aims
to provide a happy, nurturing environment where each child is as
important as the other. With our strong well-defined curriculum,
students grow into being well-rounded, happy and responsible
people.</p>
                    <p> The Student Support Services offer support and guidance to students
through access to a School Counsellor, Career Counsellor and the
facilities of the Special Needs Educator. To ensure that students fulfil
their potential, there is a support programme in place that tracks
student progress through the school year. Besides academics, we also
have on offer a plethora of extra-curricular activities ranging from
Performing Arts to Visual Arts to the more intellectual activities like
Debating.</p>
