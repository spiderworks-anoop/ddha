                    <p>(LOCR) is a program being offered to all the children residing in the boarding consists of two parts – one part will
be conducted on the campus between 3pm to 4.30pm on a daily basis and the other will cover parts of the valley
and will be conducted on Saturdays-Sundays and other holidays. This part may include journey by foot, cycle, bus
or train and an overnight stay in Tents/FRH.  </p> 
                    <p> Education is pretty broad concept that surpasses the four walls of a classroom. The core aim of education is to
foster all round development of a child. All round development essentially means intellectual, physical, moral,
sensible and social development, which will take place through LOCR. </p> 

                    <p> A Chinese proverb very aptly states, “Teach me and I will forget. Show me, and I might remember. Involve me,
and I will never forget.” To a very great extent, the theoretical knowledge is enhanced when a co-curricular
activity related to the content taught, is organized. </p>

                        <p>       Have you ever noticed those children who adorably take care of their friends? How do you think they started thinking about someone else? Gradually they developed that attitude with time. However, you can accelerate the learning of this attitude by enrolling your child in extracurricular activities. In extracurricular activities, they get a chance to be involved in the group with the peers. Moreover, they learn sharing and caring, all at once.</p>

                        <p>   Recent studies show that children’s face a lack of confidence when they feel that they are good at nothing. Not all students can equally score great in the academic work. Similarly, it is important to make them feel like they are capable of doing something. Academic grades are not the end of the world. They need to realize that they are talented. This is only possible when you enroll them in extracurricular activity of their choice. This will not only boost the self-confidence but also build their esteem. Moreover, working on something of their choice gives them the opportunity to master their talent. So, the purpose of extracurricular activities is to bring out the hidden unique talent of the child.</p>
