                    <h3>    Security and safety </h3>
                    <p> Security is paramount. Our guards are physically on duty 24/7, and
CCTV cameras monitor all activities within the school compound at
all times. We ensure parents that the security procedures exist at the
school for the safety of all. No unauthorized personnel will be
granted access under any circumstances, and all visitors entering the
grounds must produce their identification and get a Visitors’ Pass
from the Guard Office. All parents and designated drivers/domestic
helpers are required to carry their ID card to school, and show this ID
to the school security at the school entrance. </p>
