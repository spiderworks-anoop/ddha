                    <h3>  Personalized Learning Experience</h3>
                    <p>  In a society that tends toward mass production and consumption, there are still those whose primary concern is content and authenticity. </p>
                    <p> The quality over quantity concept applied to education calls for smaller class sizes and fewer pupils in the community, which enhances the experience in several important ways.</p> 
                    <p> Community spirit at the DDHA is encouraged in the pristine environment, with hostel strength limited to 150 students. This ‘boutique’ model is unique in its emphasis on relationships – moving beyond the standard of teacher to student and extending a focus on teacher to parent, student to student, parent to parent interaction, not forgetting school administrators who are far more involved with individual students than they could be in a larger school situation. At DDHA, director and other administrators pride themselves on knowing each child by their name. </p>
                    <p> “Teachers are more apt to know their students as individuals and to be familiar with the family backgrounds from which they come,”. A smaller community allows for more intimate and tailored attention to individual needs. Teachers are more likely to notice any changes in behavior or performance immediately and are able to take the necessary steps to address these issues right away – before they become big problems.</p>

                    <p>Smaller classes allow teachers to tailor their lessons and styles to meet the needs of individual students. With a low student to teacher ratio, students having difficulty are quickly identified and their particular issues rapidly addressed. A smaller scale and nimble academic organization can provide the proactive quality assurance that many parents seek for their children and their own relationship with a school.  </p>
                    <p> “Questions or concerns that parents have about their child’s learning can be quickly resolved through informal channels of communication. We are able to chat to parents on a daily basis, write little updates in a communication book or diary.” </p> 
                    <p> Just outside the city of Dehra Dun, DDHA takes environment seriously; nature and the outdoors are incorporated into the school’s curriculum. The campus is surrounded by hills and forests with the foothills of the Himalayas to the North and the Siwaliks to the south. DDHA Director Yudhistir Puran Singh believes  </p>
                    <p>DDHA also offers primary school programmes, and the average class size is twenty-five pupils. Keeping with the relationship-centric model of a‘boutique’ school, and the community integration our model calls for, both the head teacher and deputy at DDHA teach the students in addition to administrative duties. </p> 
                    <p> A full life is not necessarily synonymous with one that is crammed with as many activities as possible; and a full and rewarding education does not mean as many classrooms and peers as you can bring together. Instead, the ‘boutique’ school offers a smaller model that allows for more depth and personal focus. A quality concept facilitates communication, nurturing and a more personalized experience. And sometimes, quality means a cat and a dog on campus; what more could a child ask for?</p>
