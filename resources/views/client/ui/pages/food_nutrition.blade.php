                    <h3>  Pastoral Care </h3>
                    <p> The house dining is an important feature of Dehradun hills academyâ€™s
pastoral care. Meal times are a combination of formal lunches where
visitors are welcomed and more informal suppers and breakfasts
which all offer a good chance for staff to engage with pupils and for
pupils to feel at home.</p> 
                    <p>Our school kitchen has in-house catering team where they take
pleasure in designing menus and delivering wholesome meals. There
is a gracious and orderly atmosphere adding the dining hall as our
students take their seats before meals, beginning with prayers. </p>
                    <p>Our goal is to provide boarders with meals that are nutritious, varied
and enjoyable. Using locally and ethically produced food, we balance
this with the feedback we get from pupils and their parents. Organic
milk, home-grown vegetables, free ranging poultry eggs and cereals
provided for the mess are sourced as much as possible from our own
farms. From time to time we invite diet specialists to come and work
with children planning their food menus. Each week we choose a day
to focus on Ayurveda diet for body detox. </p>
                    <p> We ensure that the students are offered to try various cuisines, from
Indian to Continental to Chinese to South Indian food.</p>
