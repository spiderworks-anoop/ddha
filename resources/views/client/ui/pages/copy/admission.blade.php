                    <p> Dehradun Hills Academy is a Boutique Residential School. We have 27 seats for the year 2020-21</p>
                    <p>Each year not more than a handful of students are selected in the Academy. The
                        selection process takes place not only on the basis of the academic abilities of the
                        child but also more importantly on how receptive the child is to the overall concept
                        of learning at the academy, where the focus is on ‘holistic growth and subjective
                        well- being’. There is an extensive interactive session with both parents and student
                        which becomes a final basis of selection into the Academy. These include Basic
                        Behavioural Aptitude-Values or Skills. These are prerequisite skills – such as
                        Listening to Elders, (Trusting elders) Obeying orders, Interpersonal skills and Basic
                        Life Skill which includes personal hygiene and also learning to adapt in short if he has
                        the correct values, he is READY to learn. Only then can he gain from the Boutique
                        Educational Experience.</p>
