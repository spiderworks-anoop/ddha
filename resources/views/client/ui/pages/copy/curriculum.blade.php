                    <h3>  Curriculum</h3>
                    <p>The aim of the Dehradun Hills Academy is to create a curriculum that is engaging,
relevant, challenging and significant. We hope to achieve this through a structured
inquiry and the development of five essential elements: knowledge, concepts, skills,
attitudes and action. School acknowledges the importance of traditional subject
areas (language, mathematics, social studies, science, personal, social and physical
education, and arts), it also recognizes the importance of acquiring a set of skills in
context and of exploring content which transcends the boundaries of the traditional
subjects and is relevant to students in their real life.</p> 

                    <p>Dehradun Hills Academy recognizes that teaching and learning, and the assessment
of that learning, are fundamentally interdependent Parents, teachers and students
are all viewed as partners in learning. Parent-teacher conferences, student-led
conferences, three-way conferences and reports are used throughout the year as a
means of informing students and parents of learning and progress. Parents are
expected to attend all of the conferences. Parents are always welcome to arrange
conferences at school and, likewise, the School may initiate a conference with
parents at any time during the year. Student-led conferences are held once a year
and are an opportunity for students to share their learning with their
parents/guardians. Students will share their portfolios during this time and also
show their parents/guardians around their class/school. All parents/guardians and
students are expected to attend student-led conferences. The dates of the
conferences can be found on the calendar</p>
