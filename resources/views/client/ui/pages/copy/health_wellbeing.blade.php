                    <p>We look after pupils in a ‘holistic’ sense aiming where possible to
promote good health and healthy lifestyles rather than dealing
exclusively with ill health in a reactive sense.</p>
                    <p>We have our methods in place like serving Aloe Vera &amp; Amla Juice
first thing in the morning followed by mindful breathing exercises,
waling meditation, yoga asana and other fitness activities motivated
by the latest research in holistic healthcare.</p>
                    <p>We have a panel of leading doctors and pedestrians to guide us for all
our medical program needs. In addition, the School operates a
Private Medical Scheme to which parents can enroll their son or
daughter for the duration of his or her time of stay and study at
Dehradun Hills Academy.</p>
                    <p>As we are a Boutique school we lay special emphasis on safety &amp;
security and conduct regular workshops and drills related to it.</p>
